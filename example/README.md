# Functional Dart Core: Examples ðŸŽ¯

Welcome to the examples section of the **Functional Dart Core** library. This repository showcases practical applications of the Functional Dart Core's capabilities, offering a deeper exploration of Functional Programming (FP) in Dart.

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights

### Validation with FP Constructs

In validation section:

1. **Basic Validation Using `Either` and Predicates**: Learn how `Either` provides clear success/error distinction and how predicates define validation criteria.
2. **Composing Multiple Validations**: Understand how to chain validation functions for modularity and comprehensive validation.
3. **Accumulating Errors**: Move beyond single error messages to accumulate multiple validation errors for richer feedback.
4. **Complex Data Validation**: Explore intricate validation of data structures, such as user profiles, using lenses and multi-layer validators.

### Why this section?

Data validation is a cornerstone of dependable software. This section not only showcases the power of data validation but also serves as an introduction to the basics of Functional Programming (FP). By employing FP constructs from the Functional Dart Core, developers can achieve a predictable, robust, and efficient approach to validation, ensuring high-quality software.
