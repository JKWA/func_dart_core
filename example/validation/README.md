## **Introduction: The Importance of Validation and Functional Programming**

In software, the assurance of data integrity and reliability is paramount. Whether you're developing web forms, APIs, or any other data-consuming mechanism, validation ensures that incoming data adheres to expected formats and standards. Proper validation prevents a myriad of potential problems ranging from system crashes to security vulnerabilities.

**Why Validate?**

1. **Reliability**: Valid data reduces the risk of unexpected errors during processing.
2. **User Experience**: Guiding users by flagging their input mistakes can help them provide the right information.
3. **Security**: Validation can filter out malicious data, protecting your application from attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Functional Programming (FP) and Validation**

Functional Programming offers a robust platform for implementing validation. Here's why FP and validation are a perfect match:

1. **Immutable Data**: FP promotes immutability, meaning data, once defined, isn't changed. This prevents unintended side-effects, making the validation process predictable.
2. **Pure Functions**: Functions in FP give the same output for the same input, ensuring consistent validation results.
3. **Higher-Order Functions and Composability**: FP allows for the creation of small validation functions that can be combined to create more complex validators. This modularity ensures clarity, reusability, and maintainability of validation rules.

By combining the rigor of validation with the principles of Functional Programming, you not only ensure data integrity but also benefit from code that's easier to reason about, test, and maintain.

With this foundation, let's dive into the lessons to understand the mechanics of validation using Dart's Functional Programming constructs:

## **Lesson 1: Basic Validation Using `Either` and Predicates**

[In this lesson](https://github.com/JKWA/func_dart_core/tree/main/example/validation/validation_1.dart), the foundational idea is using the `Either` type to handle validation results. `Either` can return a success (`Right`) or an error (`Left`), making it a versatile tool for capturing validation outcomes.

### Concepts:

- **Either Type**: A powerful tool to differentiate between success (`Right`) and error (`Left`) outcomes.

```dart
typedef ValidationResult<T> = Either<Error, T>;
```

- **Predicates**: Simple functions that return a boolean, indicating if a certain condition holds true.

```dart
bool isNegative(int value) => value < 0;
bool isZero(int value) => value == 0;
```

---

## **Lesson 2: Advanced Predicate Handling and Validator Creation**

Building upon basic predicates, [this lesson](https://github.com/JKWA/func_dart_core/tree/main/example/validation/validation_2.dart) introduces higher-order predicates and validator creation, allowing more complex validation rules.

### Concepts:

- **Higher-order Predicates**: Combine basic predicates for advanced rules.

```dart
p.Predicate<int> isPositive = p.and<int>(p.not(isNegative))(p.not(isZero));
```

- **Validator Creation**: Constructs validators using predicates and error messages, yielding either validated data or an error.

```dart
Validator<T> Function(String) validate<T>(p.Predicate<T> predicate) {...}
```

## **Lesson 3: Error Accumulation with `NonEmptyList` and Sequential Validation**

[This lesson](https://github.com/JKWA/func_dart_core/tree/main/example/validation/validation_3.dart) teaches how to accumulate multiple errors instead of halting on the first one, giving a comprehensive understanding of all the issues with the input data.

### Concepts:

- **Error Accumulation**: Gather and report multiple validation errors at once.

```dart
Validator<T> applySequentially<T>(List<Validator<T>> validators) {...}
```

- **`NonEmptyList`**: A special type that ensures at least one item is present, perfect for collecting validation errors.

## **Lesson 4: Validating Complex Data Using Lenses and Composite Validators**

For detailed data structures like `UserData`, [this lesson](https://github.com/JKWA/func_dart_core/tree/main/example/validation/validation_4.dart) demonstrates using lenses to focus on specific parts and composite validators to ensure full validation.

### Concepts:

- **Lenses**: Functions that pinpoint specific fields in data structures.

```dart
String getName(UserData data) => data.name;
int getAge(UserData data) => data.age;
```

- **Composite Validators**: These are powerful validators created by combining simpler ones, ensuring a thorough validation process.

```dart
Validator<UserData> combineUserValidators(List<Validator<UserData>> validators) {...}
```

This structure covers the concepts introduced in the four lessons. Each lesson adds to the previously acquired knowledge, culminating in the ability to validate intricate data structures.
