# Functional Dart

Functional Dart is a Dart library that encourages functional programming principles. Inspired by [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) library in TypeScript, Functional Dart aims to bring a comprehensive set of functional programming (FP) tools to Dart developers.

## What is Functional Programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the procedural programming style, which emphasizes changes in state.

Functional programming provides several benefits, such as increased modularity and predictability. It's excellent at managing complex applications that require concurrent processing, data manipulation, and testing.

## Why Functional Dart?

Functional Dart is designed to provide a set of tools for writing functional code in Dart. It aims to create a safer and more predictable coding environment by promoting immutability, function composition, and type safety.

Functional Dart currently includes a number of powerful, flexible structures and functions commonly found in functional programming, including:

- `Eq` and `Ord` interfaces, to represent equality and ordering respectively.
- `Semigroup` and `Monoid` interfaces for abstracting over "concatenation" operations.
- Number, String, and Boolean instances for the above interfaces.
- Predicates and functions for manipulating and combining them.
- Additional utility functions and classes to aid functional programming.
